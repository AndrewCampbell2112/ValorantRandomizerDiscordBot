# ValorantRandomizerDiscordBot
Discord bot for randomizing Valorant custom games

IMPORTANT:
Make sure to add your own discord bot token in line 4 of index.js.

HOW TO RUN THE BOT:
Install node.js then in your terminal, navigate to where the index.js file is stored and use the command "node index.js".

HOW IT WORKS:
This bot runs locally using the node.js api. The bot reads messages from the discord chat on a sever and if a key phrase is read, a command will be executed, causing the bot to respond on the same text channel.
